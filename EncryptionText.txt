You are required to write a Java program for the purposes of encryption.
A Command line interface is required which will allow an operator to type in some plaintext,
and it will generate ciphertext and print it to console.
The encryption to use is the Caesar cipher, with a rightshift of 1
The range of characters is 32 to 126 inclusive.
The program should be robust and recover from all reasonable exceptions and errors.

Note: There may be changes to requirements.

Pseudocode of EncryptionApp

Declare variable of type integer shiftCounter to store shift value
Declare scanner object
Declare String userInput and store next line from scan in it
Declare userChars char[] and store userInput string in it

FOR every char in userChars
	IF char >= 32 and char <= 126



Old Pseudocode
int shiftCounter  = 1

imported scanner
use scanner to get user input
prompt user for valid input(String)

store string in a char array
loop through each char
	check if char >= 65 && char <= 90	(uppercase)
		if(char == 90)
			char -= 25	
		char + shiftCounter
	else if char >= 97 && char <= 122(uppercase)
	
	
	prompt user to choose which way to shift r/l?, store result in boolean
	prompt user to how far does he wants to shift, store it in int
	depending on where to shift, call different methods passinh character and shiftcounter, which will return shifted result
